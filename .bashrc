# TACC startup script: ~/.bashrc version 2.1 -- 12/17/2013

# This file is NOT automatically sourced for login shells.
# Your ~/.profile can and should "source" this file.

# Note neither ~/.profile nor ~/.bashrc are sourced automatically by
# bash scripts. However, a script inherits the environment variables
# from its parent shell.  Both of these facts are standard bash
# behavior.
#
# In a parallel mpi job, this file (~/.bashrc) is sourced on every 
# node so it is important that actions here not tax the file system.
# Each nodes' environment during an MPI job has ENVIRONMENT set to
# "BATCH" and the prompt variable PS1 empty.

# There are three independent and safe ways to modify the standard
# module setup. Below are three ways from the simplest to hardest.
#   a) Use "module save"  (see "module help" for details).
#   b) Place module commands in ~/.modules
#   c) Place module commands in this file inside the if block below.
#
# Note that you should only do one of the above.  You do not want
# to override the inherited module environment by having module
# commands outside of the if block[3].
